The analysis was conducted on a dataset containing customer demographics, account information, transaction history, and service usage. Key attributes included age, gender, account balance,number of products, and customer feedback.

Service Interaction: Limited interaction with bank services correlated with higher churn rates.
Customer Feedback:

Satisfaction Scores: Lower satisfaction scores were strongly associated with higher churn rates.
Complaint Frequency: Customers who lodged frequent complaints were more prone to churn.
